# Tavern Tab
Ember.js app for tracking debts and payments between a small group of people.

## About

Tavern Tab is an application for keeping track of the debts and payments needed to keep your proverbial
"tavern" up and running. Your "tavern" could be any small operation involving money moving around between
a handful of people, but Tavern Tab was designed specifically with apartment roommates in mind. Tavern Tab
is perfect for keeping track of shared bills for utilities, services, and more. It can also track personal
IOU's and payments between individuals in the group.

## What's with the name?

The original "tavern" (apartment) this app was created for was full of fantasy enthusiasts, who enjoyed fighting
dragons and evil wizards in their free time. In the fantasy literature and games we liked, taverns are iconic
places to rest and spend some coin. But the barkeep will want to receive payment on his customers' tabs eventually,
even in a fantasy world. This app was designed for people who want their home or small organization to feel as
welcoming and fun as a tavern, but still want debts paid back and tabs cleared.
